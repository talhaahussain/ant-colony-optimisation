### Prerequisites

Project was developed in Python 3. Requirements can be viewed in requirements.txt.

aco.py and elitist-aco.py require ant.py and load_data.py to run.

### Usage

The program is executed from aco.py. To run the program, type `python aco.py` into your terminal.

To run elitist-aco.py, type `python elitist-aco.py` into your terminal.

Details on modifying parameters/variables to reflect experiments can be found in the Python source code.
This is done at the call of the main method, right at the bottom of the script.

### Results

Results shown in `results.pdf` and the associated text files, which can be found in BurmaResults/ and BrazilResults/. Execution durations are also stored in the text files, and images are included in the directories.
