# ECM3412 Continuous Assessment

### Requirements

Project was developed in Python 3. Requirements can be viewed in requirements.txt.

aco.py and elitist-aco.py require ant.py and load_data.py to run.

### Execution

The program is executed from aco.py. To run the program, type "python aco.py" into your terminal.

To run elitist-aco.py, type "python elitist-aco.py" into your terminal.

Details on modifying parameters/variables to reflect experiments can be found in the Python source code.
This is done at the call of the main method, right at the bottom of the script.

### Results

Results shown in the paper, and their associated text files, can be found in BurmaResults/ and BrazilResults/. The text files are also where time durations for executions are stored.
